The data file is in Excel and is called "zander stats full.xlsx". It can therefore easily be read into your favourite data anlaysis software.<br>

You can change key parameters such as the sample size at the top of the code.<br>
This is initially in Matlab only although an Octave version will follow soon I hope.
