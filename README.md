The data file is in Excel and is called "zander stats full.xlsx". It can therefore easily be read into your favourite data anlaysis software.
There is also a simple programme in Matlab called "simzerocorr.m") which simulates the sampling distribution for the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between 2 normal random variables under the null hypothesis (r=0). You can change key parameters such as the sample size at the top of the code.
